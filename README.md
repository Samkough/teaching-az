# Teaching Adam & Zak
This is for any and all things built while Rami and I teach my two younger cousins, Adam and Zak.

## Background
During my sophomore year of university, I asked my two cousins if they were interested in programming. They told me that yes, that they are interested. And so I started to send them tutorials to learn, but that didn't end up working out because it was boring, and they didn't end up learning. They just copied the code down and never really consumed it fully. After finding this out, I decided to take another route.

## Plan
We want to just build, build and build. The best way to learn is by doing, not by watching some tutorial, especially when you're younger. On top of that, what you're building matters as well. We don't want to just build calculators and developer tools, but to actually create games! We (my cousin and I) plan on taking careful, iterative yet fun, steps to doing this. We're going to start with small, basic games that hold fundamental concepts to build their basics. And eventually, we want to build 3D games that could be played over the Internet!
