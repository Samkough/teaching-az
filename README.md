# Teaching Adam & Zak
This is for any and all things built while Rami and I teach my two younger cousins, Adam and Zak.

## Background
During my sophomore year of university, I asked my two cousins if they were interested in programming. They told me that yes, they are interested. And so I naively started to send them tutorials to learn how to code! But of course, that didn't end up working out for several reasons, the main reason being that it was BORING. And it was boring. On top of that, you don't really learn by just copying code down. That only superficially makes it as though you are learning, but in reality it's just an illusion.

## Plan
We want to just build, build and BUILD. The best way to learn is by doing, not by watching a couple tutorials, especially when you're in high school. On top of that, what you're building matters as well. We don't want to just build calculators and developer tools, but legitimate games! We (my cousin and I) plan on taking careful, iterative yet fun, steps to go about this. We're going to start with small, with some basic games that hold fundamental concepts to build their basics. And eventually, we want to build games that render graphics and could be played over the Internet on our phones!
